# Made using [@assister/chat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@assister/chat)

This is a example web chat front end. We forked @assister/chat and customized it for adding our own branding etc. This serves as an example on how you can integrate chatbots in your own website ! 

Thanks to folks at @assister/chat for this amazing app.
